  ##### What means *Lean*?
  
  >*Lean* is an approach focused on **optimizing** the **flow of products** and services across various teams and technologies to **deliver maximum value to customers**. By **eliminating waste** and streamlining operations, every action taken by the team is intentional and directly contributes to the end goals.

  ##### *Lean* Principles
  
  **1. Eliminate waste**: *Focus on removing any activities or processes that do not add value to the product or the customer. This includes reducing unnecessary steps, avoiding overproduction, and minimizing defects.*
 
  **2. Build Quality In**: *Ensure quality is maintained at every stage of the development process. This involves integrating testing and quality assurance practices early and continuously, preventing defects rather than detecting them later.*

  **3. Create Knowledge**: *Promote a culture of learning and continuous improvement. Encourage teams to document their processes, share insights, and learn from both successes and failures.*

  **4. Defer Commitment**: *Make decisions based on the latest possible information. This helps in avoiding premature decisions that could lead to rework and ensures that choices are made with the best available data.*

  ##### *Lean* Principles (Cont)
 
  **5. Deliver Fast**: *Reduce cycle times and deliver working software quickly. This allows for faster feedback from customers and the ability to respond to changing market needs swiftly.*

  **6. Respect People**: *Foster a respectful work environment where team members are valued and empowered. This principle emphasizes collaboration, trust, and the recognition of each individual's contributions.*

  **7. Optimize the Whole**: *Focus on the entire value stream rather than optimizing individual parts. This holistic approach ensures that improvements in one area do not create bottlenecks or inefficiencies in another, leading to a more efficient and effective overall process.*

  ##### What is *Kanban*?
  
  >*Kanban* is a Japanese word meaning ***"signboard"*** or "***visual board"***, and its also an agile methodology that originated in Japan and was widely used by Toyota to improve manufacturing efficiency. In software development and project management, Kanban is used to **visualize work**, **limit work in progress (WIP)**, and **maximize workflow efficiency**.

  ##### How to implement *Kanban*?
  
 **1. Current Practices**: *Map and visualize the current workflow on a Kanban board to identify how work is progressing and where bottlenecks may be.*
 
  **2. Visualize the Workflow**: *Create a Kanban board with columns representing different stages of the process (**"To Do," "In Progress," "Done"**). Move work items between these columns to show progress.*

  **3. Limit Work in Progress (WIP)**: *Set limits on the number of tasks that can be in progress in each column to prevent overload and ensure a smooth and efficient workflow.*

  ##### How to implement *Kanban*? (Cont)
  
 **4. Manage and Measure Flow**: *Monitor the workflow using metrics such as cycle time and lead time. Identify and eliminate bottlenecks to improve delivery speed and quality.*
 
 **5. Make Policies Explicit**: *Define and document clear rules for the process, including criteria for moving items between columns and managing blockers, to ensure alignment and transparency.*

 **6. Incorporate Feedback Loops**: *Hold regular meetings, such as daily stand-ups and retrospectives, to assess progress, identify issues, and make continuous adjustments.*

 **7. Incorporate Feedback Loops**: *Encourage the team to continuously seek ways to improve the process and increase efficiency, fostering a culture of incremental and ongoing improvement.*
